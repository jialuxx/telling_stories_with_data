# Final Project Part 1
[**Back to content**](README.md)
## Summary
**Topic: Covid pandemic negatively impact victims of domestic violence in U.S.**  
I want to talk about how the pandemic has pushed victims into a worse situation. Contributing factors include increased violence, increased food/family/economic insecurity, and decreased resources for support (e.g., shelter closures). 
  
## Structure  
![Storyline](/images/storyline.png)  
  
1. **Background**  
Briefly describe what domestic violence is and what types of violence are included in my discussion.
2. **Reported violence data**  
Present to the audience that reported violence increased during the pandemic and what types of violence were mostly reported.  
The most ideal chart I want to put here is:

3. **Pandemic's impacts**  
Talk about the increase in food/housing/economic insecurity and the decrease in support resources, which made things worse for victims.  
The most ideal charts I want to put here are:

4. **Actions**  
Provide tips on how we can help  

## Data
* **Increased reports**:  
  
The number of domestic violence incidents in the US increased by 8.1%;    
Source:[ National Commission on Covid-19 and Criminal Justice](https://covid19.counciloncj.org/2021/02/23/impact-report-covid-19-and-domestic-violence-trends/)  
  
The COVID-19 pandemic led to a 9.7% increase in domestic violence calls.    
Source:[ National Commission on Covid-19 and Criminal Justice](https://covid19.counciloncj.org/2020/08/18/domestic-violence/) 
  
The above two are scattered numbers. I am thinking if I can find a datatset that inculdes cases reported before the pandemic. I want to make a comparison to help the audience better understand the incresead violence. 
* **insecurity**: 
   
Eight out of ten women of color are facing food and housing insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Source:[ A study by ‘me too.’ and FreeFrom shines light on the economic impact of the pandemic on women of color survivors ](https://metoomvmt.org/the-work/research-the-economic-impact-of-covid-19-on-survivors-of-color/)  
  
There are more data about different types of resources insecurity in this report. I am thinking about redesign those graphs in the report since they emphasize more on the women of color.  
## Medium
Shorthand is my top choice since it's a perfect platforms well combines photoes, graphs and texts.  
My next step for the project is to find more data. Currently I can only find some single, scattered numbers and I feel that I need some dataset to make comparisons. It might be a hard work.
If the ideal dataset was not found, I am considering example stories as my backup plan. For instance, include an example that describe how pandemic isolate victims from family/friends, 
or an example that demonstrates economic insecurity increse the likllhood of returning to abusers.
