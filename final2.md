Some questions:   
How can i embed tableau/flourish graphs into the shorthand block? I copied the embed the link but the shorthand said it was invalid.
## User Research  
**Reseach Goals:**
1. Topic: Audience are clear about what I am taking about
2. Logic: Audience can easily follow my story
3. Confusion: Audience have few misunderstandings or cofusions

**Reseach Problems:**
1. How do you think about the topic of domestic violence during pandemic?  
A: I think it's an intersting topic, but you may need extra attention on your visualizations or images to avoid triggering discomfort in your audience.  
B: Great. And your headlines look good.  
C: love the idea. Your ending part of actions is good but please remember add some local resources so audience can know how they can help their friends.  
2. How do you feel about the logic? Is it easy to follow?  
A: You may need some transitions. I feel that the connection between your data and analysis was a bit stiff.  
B: It's very logical. I am wondering if you could some debates about domestic violence during pandemic in your introduction or background part. 
C: Pretty good. Seamless to me.  
3. Do you have any probelms or confusions?  
A: What do you mean by mentioning "calls volume" in the third graph? A little confused. And why do you put the decreasiing hotline calls graph in the data part. It's better to put the graph in your analysis part where you can explain why abusers gain more power over victims.  
B: Why you use red for decreasing graph and blue for increasing? Maybe you can exchange the color.  
C: Your annotations on city-level reports increas were confusing to me. You'd better leave more space between each element. Right now, I can not distinguish which circle matches those 4 citices on your graph.  
4. Are you convinced about my arguments?  
A: Yeah. I am persuaded.  
B: Could you clarify more about your first argumrnt in the analysis part? add some examples?  
C: Do you think deteriorating mental health also account for increased domestic violence? I think you can include such discussion in your analysis part.  
5. Your advice on improvements. 
A: Your graphs in data part are too small. If I sit at the back of the classroomï¼ŒI can not see it.  
B: Leave only unemployment grpah in you anysis part. Those two graphs about unemployment convey the same information.  
C: The background of your introduction part is a little distracting.   

**My Plans for improvements**:
* Adjust graphs in the data part. (Change the color scheme, size and annotation arrangements)
* Add transitions between data and analysis part.
* Add mental health factors in the analysis part. 
* Add local resources in the action part. 
* Combine the slope chart and bar chart or only keep slope chart.
