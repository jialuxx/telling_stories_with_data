# Overall Work   
**Storyline**  
The first thing I did after deciding the topic is designing the storyline. My initial idea was to include concept introduction, fast facts:data, analysis, and call to actions. After I did some research on this topic, I found an intersting policy tracker run by United Uniations Women. They record somre policy changes in the United States during pandemic. I want to include this information in my presentation so add a part called "Efforts being made".   
  
**Data**  
Then I started fingding data and I found it really hard to search for national data on domestic violence, and almost everything I could find was secondary data. I spent a lot of time searching journals and news articles. Another issue about the data is that they are all scattered data and I don't know how to combine them into one chart because they come from different organizations. I chose to depict them in ring charts seperately.   
  
But I didn't want all the visualizations to be ring charts, which would have bored the audience. Fortunately, I found an official data set from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that I used in a line graph to show the huge unemployment rate during the pandemic, which helped me explain the economic insecurity people were experiencing.  
  
**Visualizations**  
I download icons of boys and girls from [Alibaba Icon Library](https://www.iconfont.cn/) and used them in the first data visualization with photoshop. But this cost a lot of time. Then I turned to [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to design ring charts for those scattered data. This is a much efficient way to design visualizations. I found canva is very useful! For the line chart of unemployment rate during pandemic, I used [Flourish](https://app.flourish.studio/) to design it. It's also an very helping tool! Especially it can well embed the graph into [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/).  
  
**User Research**  
After the accomplishment of the first draft on Shorthand, I invite 3 friends to listen the presentation. They have provided me a lot of inspiring ideas!   
**Adjustments**    
1. I took the advice of my friends that I should change the color scheme of the ring chart. Two of my friends said that they were cofused by my ring chart because they felt that red should represent an increase and blue a decrease. I didn't take this into consideration when I designed it, as I only considered the overall color coordination and felt that the blue worked better with the purple background.  
2. I also resized all the visualizations because all my friends said it was hard to see some details.
3. One of my friend said it was better to put data from national hotline into the anlysis part so that audience would better understand my first argument that abusers gain more power. I think she was right, and placed the data into the analysis part.
4. I added local resources after my call to actions, since the last call to action is to help friends find some local resources. And my friends advise me to
