![Covid-19 Booster Dose Type by Primary Series Type](/images/Number-of-People-with-Booster-Dose-in-the-U.S.-by-COVID-19-Vaccine-Primary-Series-Chart.png)  
A brief annotation is attached under the initial paragraph:  
> **COVID-19 Booster Dose Type by Primary Series Type**:  
> This graph is limited to people who are fully vaccinated and have received a booster dose. It illustrates the vaccine manufacturer (i.e., vaccine type) of the COVID-19 primary series received, as well as the manufacturer of the booster dose received. The graph demonstrates that while some vaccine recipients received the same vaccine type for their primary series and booster dose, others received one type for their primary series and a different type for their booster dose.
