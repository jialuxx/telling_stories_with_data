# 11/09 Assignment 3&4: Critique by design
[**Back to content**](/README.md)  
## Initial Dataviz
Here is a data visualization coming from [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total), which demenstrates amounts of people recieving primary covid vaccine series doses and booster doses from different manufactures.

A brief annotation is attached under the initial paragraph:  
> **COVID-19 Booster Dose Type by Primary Series Type**:  
> This graph is limited to people who are fully vaccinated and have received a booster dose. It illustrates the vaccine manufacturer (i.e., vaccine type) of the COVID-19 primary series received, as well as the manufacturer of the booster dose received. The graph demonstrates that while some vaccine recipients received the same vaccine type for their primary series and booster dose, others received one type for their primary series and a different type for their booster dose.
## Critique
* What visualization are you ranking? Provide the title and web-accessible URL.

* Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently?   
  
I was first confused by the chart. It looked so complicated! There were so many colors and numbers that I didn't know where to focus my attention. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the indicators represented and then trying to figure out where they corresponded in the chart. This took a lot of eye travel. If I were a casual audience and took a glance at this chart, I wouldn't have much patience to try to understand it.  
  
However, this chart did give me some insight on how to compare percentages across categories. If there are only two categories (e.g., a comparison between Pifzer and Moderna), a proportional bar chart might be more effective.  
  
If I were a designer, I would consider leaving only the percentage numbers on the chart. There is no need to place both amounts and percentages. This repetition would be distracting. Then, I would remove those colored blocks on the Y-axis, leaving only the black font there. The other thing I'll do is delete the X axis. The percentages are already placed on the bars. the scale on the X-axis is not necessary.
  
* Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?  
  
I think the target audience is broad. Marketers for manufacturing companies, government officials involved with the vaccine, doctors, professors at public health schools, and the folk who intends to get the Covid vaccine are all likely to search for the information.  
  
I don't think it communicates the message effectively. There are too many distracting elements in the diagram that make it difficult to highlight key information. Even though I have some knowledge about data visualization and some practice, I was confused the first time I looked at it. Most importantly, understanding this complex diagram consumes a lot of time, and not every audience has that kind of patience.  
  
* Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)  
  
I think this method succeeds in recording the first impressions we get when looking at data visualizations. The benefit is that it helps designers put themselves in the shoes of their target audience. Reflecting on how to better convey the message is key to designing an effective data visualization. However, this method focuses more on the use of data and the effectiveness of the information, and somewhat neglects the analysis of visualization elements, such as colors and texts. It would be more helpful if it could be combined with Good Charts method to analyze data visualization. I would suggest adding some questions like." How do you feel about the elements in the chart, and do those that stand out accurately convey the most important information?"

I think treemap is a better visualization tool to compare those proportions.
